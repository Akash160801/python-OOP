## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental paradigm in software development, and Python is a versatile language for implementing OOP concepts. This repository provides a structured approach to learning and practicing OOP principles using Python.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- A Python interpreter installed on your local machine.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/oop-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd oop-python
   ```

3. Start exploring the code examples and exercises provided in each concept folder (e.g., `abstraction`, `encapsulation`, `inheritance`, `polymorphism`).

## Concepts Covered

- **Abstraction**: Understand how to create abstract classes and methods to define a blueprint for objects.
- **Encapsulation**: Learn how to encapsulate data within classes, controlling access to attributes and methods.
- **Inheritance**: Explore the concept of inheritance and how to create subclasses that inherit attributes and behaviors from a parent class.
- **Polymorphism**: Discover how to implement polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

## Usage

Each concept folder contains Python scripts, examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding of OOP with Python. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your knowledge.
